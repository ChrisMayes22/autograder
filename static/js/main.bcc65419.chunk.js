Your coach will review the exceptions with you.",inference:'Inference questions ask you to follow certain directions: to find the "most vivid description," or the "best transition." \n            Focus ONLY on what the question asks for. If the questions asks for a descriptive answer, \n            then don\'t worry about conciseness or what makes sense...just pick the most descriptive answer.',punctuation:"Punctuation is one of the best opportunities to improve quickly! Your coach will share resources\n            with you for learning and practicing all of the punctuation rules tested on the ACT, like our punctuation cheat sheet,\n            targeted IXL assignments, and exercises that focus on the hardest examples of different question types.",placement:'Most placement question--which ask you to find the best place in a paragraph for a sentence--have some word \n            that only make sense in context. For example, look for pronouns and transition words. For example, to whom does "he" refer? \n            If the answer is "the father," then eliminate any answers that place the test before the father is introduced.',"yes/no":'Yes/No questions ask whether you should  include or remove an excerpt from the passage. Always start by deciding \n            whether you should choose one of the "yes" answers or one of the "no" answers. To do this, ask yourself "is the excerpt\n            relevant, new information?" If so, keep it; if not, get rid of it.',"modifying clauses":'In the sentence "Running down the hill, George fell down," can you spot the modifier? It\'s the phrase \n            "Running down the hill." Phrases that begin sentences with an -ing word are always modifiers, and they must always\n            be followed by a comma and the thing they are describing. Your coach will give you some examples of bad modifiers!',"subject/verb agreement":'You should always check two things with verb-related questions: What is the subject and what is the tense?\n            The ACT makes this hard by hiding verb subjects behind interrupters and prepositional phrases...so cross them out! Turn \n            "The king of the Spaniards, Juan the Great, is kind" into "The king...is kind." ',"verb tense":'You should always check two things with verb-related questions: What is the subject and what is the tense? To\n            identify tense, find another verb THAT IS NOT UNDERLINED FOR A QUESTION and match its tense. Watch out, however: avoid \n            -ing words and to phrases like "to run," since these do not have tense.',"omit/delete":'For questions where you have 3 answers with text and 1 answer that is "OMIT/DELETE", always plug in the OMIT/DELETE\n            option first. If it works, don\'t even worry about the other sections!',possessives:'Possessives refer to nouns that own something. For example, "The dog\'s food" is a possessive phrase.\n            Remember that "dog\'s" indicates one dog owning something, while "dogs\'" indicates many. However, we only do this for nouns whose\n            plurals end with "s": we would still write "the children\'s ball", for example. Your coach will work with you through other tricky cases!',parallelism:'When phrases come in a list, they should be written with the same form. For example, "The man came running, rolling, and jumping\n            towards me" demonstrates parallelism, as does "The tall, strange, curly woman lived in the tall, strange, curly house."',transitions:"Your coach will discuss with you four types of transitions: causation, contrast, addition, and timing. The way to crack\n            transition questions is to decide what kind of transition you need to connect two parts of the sentence. Then, eliminate all transitions\n            except that type and pick the best answer from what remains.",pronouns:"Pronoun questions are similar to subject/verb agreement questions: Look for the subject the pronoun is standing in for \n            (also called the antecedent). Make sure if you substitute that word in for the pronoun, the sentence still makes sense. Then,\n            make them match for gender and number. If it's plural, use they; if it's a woman, use she...and so on.","vocab in context":"These are called vocab in CONTEXT for a reason! Don't just rely on the dictionary definition of the words: look at the \n            surrounding sentence. Is it positive in tone, or negative?

If there are \n            2 or more vocabulary terms you don't know at all, don't spend too long on the question: guess and move on.","adjectives / adverbs":'Adjectives describe nouns, while adverbs describe verbs (actions) and adjectives (descriptions). For example, in the\n            sentence "Adrian is quite green and likes to run quickly," green is an adjective, while quickly and quite are adverbs. If you see answer choices\n            like "quickly" and quick, determine if it is describing an action or a noun.',"passive voice":'If a sentence is in passive voice, that means that action is being done TO the subject. For example, "I was carried by my friends" \n            is in passive voice, as is "The paper was finally written." The ACT does not like passive voice! Always look for an active sentence, like\n            "My friends carried me" or "I wrote the paper."',"ambiguity / vagueness":'This is one of the rare exceptions to conciseness. If a word is so vague that you can\'t form a mental image of it,\n            choose a more specific answer! For example, if you see three pronouns in answer choices and "the professor of meteorology," the answer with\n            the professor is correct even though it is not at all concise!',comparisons:'Remember that "than" is used for comparisons, as in "Alaska is bigger THAN Colorado," while "then" is used to describe time. Meanwhile,\n            also bear in mind that you should use comparatives like "more" when comparing two items, and superlatives like "most" when comparing\n            three or more items.',"fixed expressions":'Certain phrases are given as standard in English. For example, if you see "either," you should always also see an "or" in\n            that same sentence. Your coach can provide you with a full list of fixed expressions!',prepositions:"Remember the word POSITION in preposition: these are words that show relationships between things, like on, under, over, through\n            by, and of.
